Non-negative matrix factorization(NMF)

In this code, I apply NMF using the tf-idf word-frequency array of Wikipedia articles given as a csr matrix articles. 
The presence of words in each document are measured using"tf-idf", where "tf" is the frequency of word in document and "idf"reduces infuence of frequent words.
